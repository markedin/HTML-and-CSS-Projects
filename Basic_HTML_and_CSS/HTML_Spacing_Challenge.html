				There is a place where the sidewalk ends<br>
				And before the street begins,<br>
				And there the grass grows soft and white,<br>
				And there the sun burns crimson bright,<br>
				And there the moon-bird rests from his flight<br>
				To cool in the peppermint wind.<br><br>

				Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black<br>
				And the dark street winds and bends.<br>
				Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow<br>
				We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
				And watch where the chalk-white arrows go<br>
				To the place where the sidewalk ends.<br><br>

				Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
				And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,<br>
				For the children, they mark, and the children, they know<br>
				The place where the sidewalk ends.<br><br>
